Hello friends! Security is an important part of what we do at Enhanced Society. It's critical to the operation of trustless networks and is often given insufficient attention. We see hardware wallets as one of the key ways to secure digital assets. 

Introducing Enhanced Societys very own hardware wallet.

It's still in early stages of development, but that's ok.. it's open source! We've teamed up with [Steve](https://twitter.com/spidie) and Skip (both pictured above) at the [Gold Coast Techspace](https://gctechspace.org/) who have started working on a PCB design ready for production.

Here's some photos of the prototype and it integrating with the iOS Ethers app.

[Richard](https://twitter.com/ricmoo), the original creator is responsive and seems interested in what we're up to. So hopefully we'll get this thing happening in production and with SDK's for other platforms.

Some of the key things we love about it here at Enhanced Society:
* open source design for hardware, software and housing
* cheap (should be under $10 to make)
* simple
* water proof case so it's CHL friendly! (We'll share more about CHL soon)

Here's a rough list of the jobs that need to be done:
* completion of PCB and production run of it
* printing enough cases to house the completed wallets
* Android SDK and integrations into apps
* iOS integration into apps other than Ethers
* iOS SDK

We're going to get stuck into some of the Android stuff ASAP.

So what's next?

Well, the project is running through the Enhanced Society ALPHA platform so we'll execute on the above jobs, obtain validation and run the concept through our quality filter.  We'll launch the crowdsale contract to start collecting funds from people who may be interested in buying one.

CALL TO ACTION required here to enable the rad to get involved if they want to invest.  I assume it's to our platform, run the KYC and send them the link to the $10 contract???
