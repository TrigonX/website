title: ICO Data Integrity Under Question

It is clear that ICO data needs to improve. Why is this information, so important to investors, regulators and the tech community at large, not made available with any guarantee on authenticity and reliability?  It is essential for anyone involved in ICOs to have a good understanding of how other ICOs have been implemented historically as well as having a handle on the state of the current ICO environment.  Access to reliable information on ICOs is imperative for investors, regulators and other players with ‘skin in the game’ for making informed decisions.  For anyone familiar with ICOs initiated in the last 12 months it is obvious that identifying quality in this space can be challenging at best!

### Exploring Available Data
I have been researching and collating ICO statistics as part of a larger goal to identify which projects have quality applications and to understand their utility.  Obtaining data on pre-sale and ICO run dates, token prices, soft and hard caps, country of origin, discounts, supply, vesting and distribution is where I started.  However, during the initial research and data gathering phase it became evident that reliable and verified data was hard to come by, with the majority of sources reliant on companies submitting their own data.  

### ...and the Challenges
Whilst sourcing data for analysis I was faced with missing data points, obvious typos, reliance on third party sources with no clarification on their data sources or definitions, conversion of figures to the same currency, massive data cleansing, formatting and lag in reporting. Classification of ICO industry was minimal and often incorrect. With over 2000 ICOs running in the last 12 months, manual clarification and data sourcing is not a viable option without resource. 

### ICO Success & Failure
It became evident that there is a significant lack of reporting on success of ICOs with more focus on completion rather than identifying whether an ICO met their set caps.  Tokendata.io applies a status for ICOs once they pass their end date yet it appears the number of ICOs with status of Failed is lower than we might expect (anecdotal) and there is a lag (as expected) in the more recent ICOs.


To get a feeling for failure rates within a larger dataset than that available in tokendata.io I applied the following logic:

* If status is ‘Failed’ in tokendata.io; OR
* If total $ raised is zero or unreported and ICO end date prior to today; OR
* If total $ raised is less than 80% of total cap if one was set (where both figures available in USD) and  ICO end date prior to today.

### Failure Rates Insights
Over the last 12 months failure rates look to have increased from 20% to a high of 71% in Dec ‘17 and tracking around 55% this year. It is important to note that failure rate refers to the ICO investment phase and the definition applied here may not be ideal classification but it is a start.  It would be incredibly valuable to be able to apply further analysis down the track to this dataset, ideally when we can get more of this baseline data verified, and begin to analyse success based on utility, progress against milestones and community engagement.

### Data Verification
I also discovered there is no easy way to confirm that the token sale framework was implemented as stated.  It seems there is a lack of transparency and authenticity within existing ICO statistics and it became clear that there is no one source of truth openly accessible to the community.   

### Can it be done better?
Is there an opportunity for making such data available through provision of on-chain verified data?  We would love to see existing players in the ICO stats field implement data integrity measures to provide guarantees on data quality and provide open access to such information.  Supporting collaboration between existing data sources and driving action towards higher data integrity in the industry would align with Enhanced Society’s values of transparency, authenticity and promotion of utility.


#### Data Sources & Disclaimer
Data sources incorporated into our ICO analysis include tokendata.io, coinschedule.com, etherscan.io, cryptoslate.com.  

Data has not been verified...how good would it be if our community could drive this change and make this dataset available for future reference?
