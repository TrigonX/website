# Centralised vs Decentralised

Decentralised exchanges (dEXs) are fast becoming a viable alternative to the established centralised exchanges ruling the crypto marketplace to date.  The benefits of a decentralised exchange are mainly around security and trust.  Large centralised exchanges that store data and manage transactions off-chain are vulnerable to hacking and security breaches and lack the transparency so valued in the cryptocurrency space.

There are a number of protocols decentralised exchanges are utilising to operate their exchanges, or relays, including 0x, graphene (bitshares) and swap.  To better understand this decentralised exchange ecosystem we have set out to track daily volume, transactions and token activity through these entities.  This will provide a tool for investigating and identifying success and quality in this space.


## 1. Decentralised Exchanges
Data on decentralised exchange activity has been collated from 2 sources: coinmarketcap.com and the Ethereum blockchain.  It is important to note that we have utilised exchange data from coinmarketcap (cmc) where available due to its breadth and quality of data in easily accessible formats.

When daily volumes are compared for all decentralised exchanges and relayers (where available) we can see the top performers are Ethfinex (0x protocol), Waves (built on its own platform and blockchain) and Bitshares (graphene protocol). 
Decentralised exchanges are **averaging USD$30M per day**.

### Ethereum dEX Data
The below 2 charts show data from decentralised exchanges on Ethereum over a 2 week period.  From the data you can see the volatility in daily volume with only a few exchanges transacting significant volumes on a daily basis.  0x relayers are currently accounting for approximately 4% of volume compared to exchanges operating on other decentralised protocols.

The above chart is sourced from etherscan and shows total number of transactions by exchange from inception.  Ether Delta and IDEX are clear front runners at present and responsible for 94% of total transactions to date. However, there are a few more decentralised exchanges doing more volume as identified by coinmarketcap.  It is unclear why etherscan is not reporting some of these exchanges.

### Coinmarketcap dEX Data
Coinmarketcap exchange tracking shows utilisation of the 0x, graphene and other decentralized protocols to be steady with no significant growth over the period tracked since 21st June.

Likewise, the below chart tracking exchanges daily volume doesn’t reveal any significant growth for the period since 21st June.

## 2. Centralised Exchanges
Centralised exchanges are currently responsible for 99% of daily volume (approx. USD$3 billion) while the decentralised exchanges are transacting only 1% (approx. USD$30 million).  There are 208 exchanges reported on coinmarketcap with 19 of these decentralised. Tracking the success of decentralised exchange volume is probably best done in isolation at present due to the established centralised exchanges operating in the space.  The top 4 centralised exchanges are transacting in excess of 1 billion USD daily so there is a way to go before decentralised exchanges will impact on this space. 

# Summary
It can be suggested, from the growing number of new decentralised exchanges entering the market and the stability in their volume as a whole, that dEXs are here to stay.  Despite centralised exchanges being responsible for the lion’s share of the market, there are important problems these decentralised protocols are commonly addressing in security, trust and transparency.

We may see dEXs gain traction by specialising in particular tokens that are harder to trade via larger centralised exchanges, or build traction through affiliation and partnership with successful projects which promote the value in utilising decentralised exchanges.  This industry is still new and we will continue to track success and utility in the space.


#### Data Sources, Disclaimer & Further Reading
Data sources include coinmarketcap.com, the Ethereum blockchain and list of relayers using 0x protocol available here https://github.com/0xProject/0x-relayer-registry. Reasonable efforts have been made to access verified data where available.

Great summary article on decentralised vs centralised exchanges and breakdown different protocols with associated relayers.
