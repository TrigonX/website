Thanks for taking interest in what we are up to at Enhanced Society.  As you'll notice I refer to 'we' a great deal.  That's because this jounrey is not about me or even about one company, but rather the collective community of great people around us.  

Here's some insight into my way of thinking:

We are a group of awesome and very active people on the East Coast of Australia, striving to live authentic and purposeful lives. 

We live a Creative Healthy Lifestyle every day, which basically means that we focus on our health and positive energy, being very active in nature, always improving our learning methods and using technology for empowerment.

We are on a mission to empower human creativity. We want to see everyone having a fair chance at building a better world and becoming part of technology innovation and entrepreneurship.

We want to see a world less driven by a few dominating platforms and more driven by local communities that create sustainable businesses in an open and inclusive way.

We are currently focusing on using technologies like blockchain and machine learning to make it easier and safer to invest and raise money for blockchain projects.

We are great believers of open source and community driven projects, so we share everything we do, both our code and our learnings.

We try to share our learnings and empower the ecosystem around us through the universities (Bond University and Griffith University), the city council, meetup groups, events, tech spaces, startups, incubators, etc.

Letâ€™s build a better future together, come join us:

Telegram - chat with us
Medium - all our learnings in optimised bite-sized one pagers (under construction)
Developers - Github repository
Meetup - join one of our meetups around blockchain, entrepreneurship, etc.
