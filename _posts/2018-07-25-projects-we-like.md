We like infrastructure because we are technology geeks. Secondly it is the things that are easier to evaluate and validate, because they scale fast in the blockchain space, we can directly see the usage and development. We also believe that a big part of the blockchain space is about building better infrastructure for everyone, but most people won’t (and shouldn’t) know that there is blockchain underneath the products that they use. They just need: faster, better and easier or in other words more value with less friction (convenience).

And most importantly these projects are very aligned around the Enhanced Society values.

Here is our current Ethereum blockchain project love list:

0x - Open source infrastructure for p2p blockchain trading - this is just awesome!
Loom - Really cool and smart team that are leading in building real world scalable Ethereum solutions that can be used right now!
OmiseGO - Global inclusive infrastructure for payments
MakerDAO - Some of the few that are doing things more fair and with quality
Web3 foundation - Defining the new Internet
Kybernetwork - A really cool solution to decentralised trading
Toshi - Totally open source driven. Bringing web3 to everyone. Values so aligned with ours that we could have written them ourselves.
Status - Similar to Status.
Golem - Really good use case of a token. Huge potential for decentralised Amazon.
Gnosis
Uport - Really cool project to build and manage decentralised identity
Quantstamp
Tendermint
