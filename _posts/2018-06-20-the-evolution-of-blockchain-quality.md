#How can we better evaluate the quality of a blockchain project?

There is so much hype and speculation in the blockchain space, as well as geekiness, that it is very difficult for anyone to understand what is real and what is hype.

#Here's what's real

*Blockchain technology is at the core the most trusted system on the planet
*There is a potential to build online systems with more inclusivity, openness, privacy and security
*Using tokenomics/crypto-economics we have a new way to program incentives with blockchain technology

#And here's some hype

*According to general news blockchain technology will solve all our problems
*Majority of token projects and ICOs are overhyped; most will fail to deliver on their promises

#The need to filter

Enhanced Society has developed a method to better evaluate the quality of a blockchain project.

We describe quality blockchain solutions as:

1. Easy - low friction for people, clear what it does
2. Useful - direct benefit for user, how well validated
3. Secure - what’s at risk, how complex, how well tested, how well audited
4. Legal - what’s the risk, which region
5. Open - open source, inclusive, transparent, authentic 

We will go into more details on each of the quality evaluation parameters in the next posts.

#Current Tool Box

We are constantly building better tools to automate the quality evaluation method. Here you can start using our tools and be part of improving them if you would like to:

#Teach
This is the best way to help others evaluate quality. To improve our original question we can now ask: 
"Which of the blockchain quality evaluations: easy, useful, secure, legal and open is important and relevant to me right now?"
