# Overview
It has been identified that having current and accurate ICO data will assist future ICOs to better understand the environment.  This will, in turn, provide a framework for determining viable token features such as caps, run dates and sale prices. It is also integral to track any changes to status, classification and trends within the space which will facilitate informed decision making and promotion of utility and quality.

It has become evident that a lack of authenticity, transparency and accessibility of ICO statistics pose issues for future use in this industry.  It is also clear that there is no one source of truth where data has clearly been verified and made available for open access.  This suggests there may be an opportunity for making available a single point of access to complete, comprehensive and verified ICO data in the blockchain industry.  This may include provision of on-chain verified data, collaboration between existing sources to encourage implementation of data integrity measures to ensure their data is verified and reliable,  alignment between third party providers to verify data or a combination of all options.

## ICOs
There are currently issues with ICO data availability, data integrity and under-reporting of failure.  However, the current dataset can still provide some insights into the general ICO ecosystem over time as well as act as a resource for applying a future quality framework across for testing token intelligence layer criteria.

The below chart shows ICOs by end month since March 2016 and reveals the increase in activity in the space since mid 2017.  Total ICOs completing each month has dropped off in June 2018.

## Failure Rates
When reviewing failure rate for ICOs since January 2017 we can see this increases from 20% to over 50% from August last year which corresponds to the inflation in ICO activity seen above.  This data suggests the hype around ICOs as a tool for raising capital resulted in many non-viable projects attempting to ride the hype of the industry.

## Amount raised
ICOs have raised significant funds over the last year. The chart below shows a huge increase last month which is a result of the completion of the EOS ICO. This ICO ran for a year, raising over $4 billion USD to build their infrastructure, team and community.

The next chart below shows a more realistic picture with EOS removed from the dataset. The average funds raised per ICO hasnâ€™t dropped off much but the total raised has decreased significantly for June 2018.

## Top ICOs by Funds Raised
Over the last 18 months the top fundraising ICOs have been achieving in excess of 100 million USD (see tables below for 2017 and 2018).  Many are not setting soft or hard caps for their raises while some are exceeding their caps by a phenomenal amount (see Dragon & Bankera in 2018 table below as examples).

# Summary
The ICO environment is a fast moving and volatile space which is relatively new and unregulated.  While this can be a perfect launch pad for innovation free from conventional fundraising requirements, it cannot help but attract projects hoping to piggyback on the hype around such a shift in capital raising culture. 
This review has been conducted on the ICO investment phase and makes no inroad into analysing ICO success based on utility, progress against milestones or token supply, release rate, etc.  It would be incredibly valuable to continue analysis post ICO phase to apply an intelligence layer against this dataset with a framework for identifying value and progress.

* **Tokendata.io** - Using as base list for ICOs; Full list of ICOs by status (Planned, Active, Completed, Failed) with total raised USD & token sale price; data set smaller than other sources
* **Coinschedule.com** - Total raised and industry categories, Limited listing
* **Cryptoslate.com** - Comprehensive ICO stats; Data reliant on manual entry so holes and data quality issues with currency, typos etc. Requires more cleansing but enough good data to gain more insights into caps, success and database of token distribution and allocation 
* **Coinmarketcap.com** - Daily coin prices
