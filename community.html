	<p class="grey-text">
		At Enhanced Society we aim to live up to our name and provide a platform that allows the community to collaborate and contribute whilst being rewarded for their efforts. You'll find 'quality' is at the core of everything we focus on and as a result develop tools that focus on truth and validation.

			<p class="grey-text">
				We need to learn how to filter through this crazy world of information overload, social media mesmerisation and disconnection with our human race to obtain clarity on what is most integral to our existence.

			<h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-3">Experiment</h5>
			<p class="grey-text">
				To test our learning we experiment. We challenge the status quo. We must take risks to ensure we are continually learning so we can make a more positive contribution within our community.

			<h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-3">Teach</h5>
			<p class="grey-text">
				We teach what we know in order to share our knowledge and confirm our own understanding of the information we have learnt.  Therefore we are learning to teach and consolidation of what’s real and what’s made up can be processed.

		<p class="grey-text">
				Here's a few meetups we've held and events we've attended.  With so much activity in this space right now, it's important that we share quality and vertified insight and attend valuable events that will extend our knowledge. If you have an event you think it worthwhile for the team to attend please reach out.
