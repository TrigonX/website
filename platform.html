			<h1 class="h1-responsive">Platform</h1>
			<p>We’re excited about the idea of combining the brain power of our community together with blockchain technology and Machine Learning. So we’ve decided to build a platform that does exactly that.  
The platform will provide a step by step framework for new and existing businesses to go from start to finish of a token sale event.</p>

			<p>Businesses can leverage the power of the Enhanced Society community to help solve the challenges along the way of creating a token that adds real value to society. This will be achieved through a bounty functionality where the business can offer tokens in exchange for high quality contributions from the community.</p>
			<p>Businesses also get access to our highly engaged investor network and can offer early investor incentives like discounts at each step of the process. Investing directly into a specific project is only one way to participate, investors can also decide to stake Enhanced Society Tokens and receive a portion of tokens from every ICO project that runs on the platform. In exchange for staking their Enhanced Society Tokens investors get voting rights allowing them to influence the quality expected for each ICO project to pass from one step to the next in the token sale process.</p>
			<p>We see machine learning becoming a game changer over the next couple of years and we believe that having access to this type of super-power should be a human right, not just something that is exclusive to a couple of the big companies. That’s why we’ll be focused on making this technology available for our community. At first as a part of our quality engine and then wherever our community sees fit.</p>
			<p>The ultimate goal of the platform is to empower human creativity and build high quality businesses that add real value to the world. </p>
