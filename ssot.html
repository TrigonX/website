  <h2 class="my-5">Single Source of Truth</h2>
	<p class="grey-text">
Enhanced Society has developed a Single Source of Truth decentralised app which allows authors to sign off on their content using their Ethereum address. This technology is one of the most significant key pieces to combat the increasing issue of scam and phishing attacks in the crypto space and offers a solution to the growing fake news issue by verifying the originality of a piece of content with a industry leading cryptographic hash.
<br><br>
The Single Source of Truth decentralised app is free to use on the hosted and open source Enhanced Society platform. Enhanced Society invites anyone to contribute to the project or fork it and tailor it to their own needs.

  <h2 class="my-5">Problem</h2>
	<p class="grey-text">
		The crypto space has a long history of scam and phishing attacks leading to multi-million dollar losses for unknowing crypto investors. Scammers use fake phishing websites and fake social media accounts to trick investors out of their money.
<br><br>
		However not knowing what and who to trust is not just a problem in the crypto and blockchain space. Over the last few years fake news have become a central issue in the media landscape. Most famously through the alleged fake news propaganda attack in the 2016 US elections.

  <h2 class="my-5">Solution</h2>
	<p class="grey-text">
With Enhanced Society’s Single Source of Truth decentralised app authors can create an announcement and sign it using their Ethereum key pair (tied to their public address). The announcement publish date, content and title are included in the signature hash, meaning it is inherently resistant to modification. Once recorded, the data in any signature cannot be altered retroactively without the recreation of all existing signatures.
<br><br>
		Readers can then validate the original author by querying the signatory’s Ethereum address using services such as Etherscan.
<br><br>
		An example; <a href="https://app.enhancedsociety.com/announcements/bec0786a-783e-4ad6-845c-a8ffb91f24e8" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see a demo of the Enhanced Society project’s Single Source of Truth page.
		<br><br>
		Here is the address that signed the message on <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xd694E840d073716b913040cbE41d691cF7Be42E7" target="_blank">Etherscan</a>
The signature verification (the green tick) is calculated after page load. By integrating directly with the Ethereum blockchain the validity of the signature is checked on the fly in the user’s browser. Because it’s completely open source and the code is in the web browser there are multiple ways to audit and verify the functionality of the verification code. If you see the green tick, you know the message has been signed by that Ethereum address.
<br><br>
In many respects this process works a lot like PGP signatures do, except it has the power of the ubiquity of Ethereum. In the way that you could sign an email or document with a PGP key, the SSOT page allows you to attest to the integrity of your content by having you and others sign the content with an unhackable cryptographic hash.
